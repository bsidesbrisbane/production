## Why Volunteer?
Volunteering at BSides Brisbane is a fantastic opportunity to immerse yourself in the cyber security community, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to an event that thrives on collaborative spirit. Whether you're looking to network, learn new skills, or simply give back, your involvement will make a significant impact.

## What Do We Need?
While we run pretty lean overall, there are still a number of support roles we need, these include:

* **Registration Team**: Welcome attendees, handle check-ins, and distribute any conference materials.
* **Speaker Support**: Assist speakers with their setup and ensure sessions run smoothly.
* **Event Operations**: Help with the overall event logistics, from setup to teardown.

## Why Do You Need My Information
At BSides Brisbane, the safety and well-being of our volunteers are our top priorities. As part of our commitment to ensuring a safe and secure environment, we have legal obligations to collect certain information from all volunteers for insurance purposes. This information helps us provide appropriate coverage and support in the event of any unforeseen incidents.

**Please note**: All volunteers must be 18 years or older to participate in BSides Brisbane.
