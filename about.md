## A bit about us
BSides Brisbane was founded by [joshua1909](https://twitter.com/joshua1909){:target="_blank"} and [bman013](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brodiecarter){:target="_blank"}, driven by a desire to create something unique to the local Brisbane cyber security scene. 

It isn't your typical cyber tech conference; it's more like a cyber jam session where knowledge and experiences collide. We've been running wild since 2019, hosting sessions that dive deep into live hacks, defensive measures, effective security policy, and everything in between. Our vibe? Casual, inclusive, and downright passionate about all things cyber.

Since we kicked off, we've been crafting an atmosphere where bytes meet banter, and everyone is welcome to geek out and grow together.

## The vibe
Each BSides is a community driven framework for building events for and by information security community members. The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time. It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening. It won’t all be perfect, in fact I would be surprised if any of it really is, but we will be busting our ass to make sure everyone that attends gets the most out of it as they possibly can, and that everyone has a blast.

## Our vision
When this whole thing first kicked off, we wanted to do something different. We didn’t want to deliver a 4 track conference with a vendor hall and an overloaded schedule with so much content that would ultimately lead to attendees being overwhelmed (and underwhelmed). Our true vision for BSides is to deliver content in a slightly different way, a focus on more workshop and interactive style presentations and events. We want to raise security awareness, assist in learning, and have likeminded and passionate people connect in fun and interesting ways. All while keeping the conference accessible and affordable to all.

## Extended thank you
We would love to use this opportunity to extend a huge thank you to everyone that has attendance, or assisted in the running of BSides Brisbane over the past few years. A special callout however to Bruce Large aka. [bELarge/BFL](https://twitter.com/beLarge){:target="_blank"} for the continued support through both MC and his presentations, and as well to [nomad](https://twitter.com/nomadhax){:target="_blank"} for his thankless efforts in running the CTF year on year. Without the people we have supporting us, there would be no conference.
