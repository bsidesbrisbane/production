## Why support BSides Brisbane?
Recent successes in Australia and abroad have shown that the information security community continues to grow and along with it, the number of BSides events worldwide continues to increase, each event drawing a bigger crowd. BSides Brisbane was born from a desire to give back to the local Brisbane security community. This year will be the third time running this conference, and we promise to again deliver high quality content, keep the audience and attendees engaged, all while keeping the cost down to ensure its affordable to all.

## Safe and engaging
We promote a safe and engaging space for all attendees to have fun. In our first year, BSides Brisbane saw over 300 attendees walk through the doors, with fantastic feedback directly and on social media highlighting an appreciation for the quality presentations, networking opportunities, and unique capture the flag events throughout. We were greatful that for our second event in 2020, during the COVID pandemic, we were able to deliver the largest in-person Security conference in Australia. We hope to further entice repeat attendance from last year’s event, as well as from community members who would usually not attend these events.

The goal of BSides Brisbane is to offer events where all participants can engage each other to help develop connections, friendships, and network with different industry professionals. We recognise the value in engaging a smaller audience and providing the opportunity for sponsors to be a big fish in a small pond. We specifically design different options so that any sized organisation can participate and support this event. The following is a list of direct benefits you may see as an event sponsor.

## Brand placement and awareness
Depending on the level of sponsorship you select, you may receive brand placement at some or all the following: t-shirts, signage/lanyards, lunch sessions, or attendee badges. Creative and custom branding may be arranged including transportation, banners, and podcast interviews.

## Connected to the local industry
BSides enables its supporters and participants to identify and connect with industry leaders and voices. Participants represent the social networking of security. They are the people you want to engage and solicit feedback from and who will give a voice to your conversation.

## Big fish, small pond
For some, sponsoring large events is not within their price range, leaving them with no ability to communicate their message. At BSides we leave no one out. Sponsorship comes in all sizes and this community atmosphere brings together active and engaged participants who want to listen. As a sponsor you can be heard and share your message to an active and attentive audience.
