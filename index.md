## Engaging Presentations
Immerse yourself in a diverse range of informative and thought-provoking presentations at BSides Brisbane. Covering the latest trends, best practices, and emerging challenges in cyber security, our lineup features renowned experts and thought leaders. They will share their insights on topics such as vulnerability research, threat intelligence, and risk management. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a newcomer to the field, these presentations offer a unique opportunity to expand your knowledge, gain practical insights, and stay ahead of the cyber security curve.

## Capture the Flag
Embark on a cyber security adventure with our Capture the Flag (CTF) event. Join the thrill at BSides Brisbane by participating in our exciting CTF event, blending jeopardy-style challenges with an Active Directory (AD) attack lab. Immerse yourself in an interactive and competitive environment, where participants can showcase their skills, solve intricate puzzles, and navigate through AD scenarios that are representative of real life.

CTF events are designed to test participants' cyber security skills through a series of challenges that simulate real-world scenarios. These challenges can range from basic tasks, such as cracking a password or uncovering hidden data, to more complex puzzles involving system exploitation and defence mechanisms. Participants work either individually or in teams to solve these puzzles and capture "flags", which are specific pieces of information or tokens hidden within the challenges. Each flag captured earns points, and the team with the most points at the end of the event wins. CTFs provide an active and hands-on learning experience, allowing participants to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical, high-pressure situations while fostering teamwork and problem-solving skills.

## IoT & Hardware Hacking
Immerse yourself in Internet of Things (IoT) security at BSides Brisbane. Our dedicated IoT Village features hands-on workshops, live hacking demonstrations, and collaborative discussions with experts, providing a unique platform to explore the challenges and solutions within the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things. Gain practical insights, connect with professionals, and stay informed about the latest trends in IoT security.
